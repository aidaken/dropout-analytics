# Deck outline (10 slides in progress, but here is template of what will do)

1) Title: Onboarding drop-off at payment step
2) Funnel snapshot (chart + table)
3) Where we lose users (volume vs relative)
4) Why payment step matters (revenue-proximate)
5) Hypotheses (friction, card not ready, trust, failures)
6) Proposed fix (bundle)
7) Tracking plan (events + metrics)
8) Experiment plan (A/B, primary + guardrails)
9) Expected impact (uplift scenarios, $)
10) Decision: ship test now, what comes next
